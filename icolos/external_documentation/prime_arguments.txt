$SCHRODINGER/prime_mmgbsa [<options>] <struct_file>

    Any option can be placed in an input file for ease of use.  The input
    structure should be specified on a line using "STRUCT_FILE <input mae file>".
    All other options should be placed one-per-line with the preceding dash
    removed.  For example, the following two calculations are equivalent:

    > prime_mmgbsa file_pv.mae -job_type ENERGY -lcons SMARTS.C

    or

    > prime_mmgbsa input.inp

    where the contents of input.inp are:

        STRUCT_FILE file_pv.mae
        JOB_TYPE    ENERGY
        LCONS       SMARTS.C

    Note that HOST, SUBHOST and NICE flags must be set via the commandline.

    All atoms in the ligand will have the i_psp_Prime_MMGBSA_Ligand property
    set to 1, so that asl expressions can then be used for specifying parts of
            the structure relative to the ligand.  For example,
        "fillres within 5 (atom.i_psp_Prime_MMGBSA_Ligand 1)"
    selects all residues within 5 Angstroms of the ligand.

    SMARTS expressions can be included in all asl expressions.  The command
    -lcons SMARTS.C will apply constraints to all aliphatic carbons in the ligand.

    run $SCHRODINGER/prime_mmgbsa -h for a complete listing of all options.


positional arguments:
  struct_file           For most situations, this should be a Maestro file
                        with the receptor as the first entry, followed by the
                        ligand poses (e.g. a Glide pose viewer file). If the
                        -ligand option is specified, then the input should
                        instead be a Maestro file with each entry containing a
                        protein-ligand complex.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -report_prime_log REPORT_PRIME_LOG
                        (yes/no) Return an output file with the extension
                        .Prime.log with the Prime logfiles of all component
                        jobs. By default this in included if less than 100
                        ligands are used
  -csv_output CSV_OUTPUT
                        (yes/no) Return a csv format output file -out.csv with
                        the calculated energies.
  -report_top REPORT_TOP
                        Report the specified number of top-scoring ligands in
                        the log file. All ligands are reported in the CSV and
                        structure output files.
  -v                    show program's version number and exit
  -jobname JOBNAME, -JOBNAME JOBNAME, -j JOBNAME
                        Set the base name of outputs
  -restart_file RESTART_FILES
                        Output of a partially completed subjob (this keyword
                        can be can be used multiple times if there are
                        multiple completed subjobs)
  -RESTART              Guess names of restart files for -restart_file option

Input:
  -ligand LIGAND_ASL    Specify the ligand with an asl expression (required
                        for trajectory processing). If this option is present
                        then the input should be a maestro input file with
                        each entry containing both the ligand and the
                        receptor. The asl expression provided here will be
                        used to determine which part of the complex structure
                        is the ligand.

Output:
  -out_type {PV,COMPLEX,LIGAND,FLEXIBLE,COMPLETE}
                        The type of Maestro file to output. Choices are PV,
                        COMPLEX, LIGAND, FLEXIBLE and COMPLETE . LIGAND
                        produces a ligand-only file. PV will produce a
                        combination of the input receptor and the optimized
                        ligand positions. COMPLEX will return the optimized
                        ligand and receptor conformations. FLEXIBLE outputs
                        the optimized conformations of the flexible portions.
                        Please note that this is not a full protein structure
                        and cannot be used for any subsequent calculations. Of
                        these, only COMPLEX will return the full optimized
                        receptor conformation. PV files are default if
                        inputting a PV file, COMPLEX files are the default if
                        inputting a series of complexes. COMPLETE includes the
                        optimized free receptor and ligand structures to the a
                        complex output file

                        for a description of available options. If you would
                        like to change the force field from it's default value

  -use_ligand_charges   Use the partial charges in the input ligand file.
  -frozen               Do not treat any part of the ligand or receptor as
                        flexible. This overwrites the -ligand_region and
                        -receptor_region flags.
